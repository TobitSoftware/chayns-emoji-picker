# Getting Started

## Setup

First off all you have to install the package.

```bash
# Yarn
yarn add chayns-emoji-picker

# NPM
npm i chayns-emoji-picker
```

Then you can import the component in your code:

```ts
import { EmojiPicker } from 'chayns-emoji-picker';
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use the component is by adding it inside of the component you
want to use as the "anchor", e.g. the button that should open the picker.

The anchor must have either `position: relative`, `position: absolute` or
`position: fixed` for the popup to be correctly positioned.

You always have to pass the `show` and `onHide` props to the picker like so:

```ts
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export function MyComponent() {
    const [showEmojiPicker, setShowEmojiPicker] = useState(false);

    return (
        <button
            style={{ position: 'relative' }}
            onClick={() => setShowEmojiPicker(true)}
        >
            Show Emoji Picker
            <EmojiPicker
                show={showEmojiPicker}
                onHide={() => setShowEmojiPicker(false)}
            />
        </button>
    );
}
```

If this is not an option for you, e.g. if the popup is cut off because one of
the parent elements of the button uses `overflow: hidden`, refer to the
"Positioning" docs.
