# Positioning

The Emoji-Picker will always be placed relative to an anchor element. An anchor
element is usually also the trigger for the popup, e.g. a button with a smiley
on it.

You can control in which direction the `<EmojiPicker>` will primarily go. The
`vertical` prop controls wether the Picker will go above or below the anchor,
while the `horizontal` prop controls wether the picker should go to the left or
the right.

For establishing a relative position to the anchor node there are two different
modes:

## Relative Positioning

The default positioning mode, relative positioning, requires you to place the
`<EmojiPicker>` component inside of the anchor element you want to use.

The anchor element then requires a relative or absolute positioning. Example:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export function MyComponent() {
    const [showEmojiPicker, setShowEmojiPicker] = useState(false);

    return (
        <button
            style={{ position: 'relative' }}
            onClick={() => setShowEmojiPicker(true)}
        >
            Show Emoji Picker
            <EmojiPicker
                show={showEmojiPicker}
                onHide={() => setShowEmojiPicker(false)}
            />
        </button>
    );
}
```

Here the `<EmojiPicker>` component makes use of `position: absolute` to position
itself relative to the button.

> This is the recommended way to use the component, if possible.

## Positioning With Measurement

Sometimes relative positioning might not be possible. A parent component of the
anchor node may specify `overflow: hidden`, which would cut the Picker off.

To tackle these kinds of situations there is also another positioning mode that
constantly measures the anchor node and positions the `<EmojiPicker>` component
fixed. The DOM-node is injected as a child directly into `document.body`.

To activate this mode pass the `anchor` prop. It should either be a HTMLElement
directly (e.g. received via `document.querySelector`) or a React Ref object of
the anchor element.
